This is a casual game in which the player is trying to save an apple tree. It does that by navigating on it with the mouse and removing worms with left-click.

The player removes worms by repeatedly clicking on them, until a UI-bar is filled. This rapid and repeated clicking is
implemented intentionally because you want the user to engage actively and distract himself from the medical procedure.

When the player removes a worm, the game replaces it immediately with another one. This supplies the player with endless worms that need removal and forces the user to constantly seek new worms.
This keeps the user focused on the game for the whole the duration of the game session.

Every game session last for 60 seconds. This duration is selected because it gives the player breathing space between sessions. As a result when the player starts
every new session has better chances of focusing completely on the game and immerse himself in the game world.

I know that the assignment had to be completed in 2 days. After I had worked on the project for 2 days, I decided that graphics were important for a distracting user experience.
So, I spend another day making the graphics. I am not an illustrator or anything like that. I just like doodling for fun...

I had a good time creating this game. Hope you have some fun playing it.
